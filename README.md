## Assignment 1
1. Make a wikipedia-like page for yourself. It should contain headings (h1), subheadings (h2), subsubheadings (h3) (if needed) etc. Putting sections within the html5 <section tag would be nice. Use CSS a little CSS goes a long way.
2. Make the sections collapsible, ie, when you click the heading, everything under the heading in that section should collapse, and when you click the heading again, it should expand. (you probably want to write js for this)
3. Automagically generate a Table of Contents that looks like
  1. Early Life (h1)
  2. Career (h1)
    1. First Job (12)
    2. Second Job (h2)
  3. (and so on)
